# Stock-Price-Predictor

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The LSTM model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and data is visualized using Matplotlib.

##Overview
#Features
* Data Fetching: Retrieves historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance.
* Data Preprocessing: Scales and prepares the data for LSTM input.
* LSTM Model: Builds and trains an LSTM model to forecast stock prices.
* Evaluation: Measures model performance and visualizes the results.
* Future Prediction: Predicts stock prices for a specified number of future days.
* Command-Line Interface: Allows flexibility in input parameters.
#Technologies Used
* TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
* Matplotlib: For data visualization.
* yfinance: For fetching historical stock data.
* scikit-learn: For data scaling and evaluation metrics.
